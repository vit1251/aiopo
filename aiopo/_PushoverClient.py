        Pushover API request is HTTPS POST request:

          token (required) - your application's API token
          user (required) - the user/group key (not e-mail address) of your user (or you), viewable when logged into our dashboard (often referred to as USER_KEY in our documentation and code examples)
          message (required) - your message 

        Some optional parameters may be included:

          attachment - an image attachment to send with the message; see attachments for more information on how to upload files
          device - your user's device name to send the message directly to that device, rather than all of the user's devices (multiple devices may be separated by a comma)
          title - your message's title, otherwise your app's name is used
          url - a supplementary URL to show with your message
          url_title - a title for your supplementary URL, otherwise just the URL is shown
          priority - send as -2 to generate no notification/alert, -1 to always send as a quiet notification, 1 to display as high-priority and bypass the user's quiet hours, or 2 to also require confirmation from the user
          sound - the name of one of the sounds supported by device clients to override the user's default sound choice
          timestamp - a Unix timestamp of your message's date and time to display to the user, rather than the time your message is received by our API
